## Outline
1. Using python and machine learning method to do the prediction:  
    The main process contains:  
        data preprocessing;   
        use visualization tools to get the rough hints of the trend and relations;  
        Do the data modeling:  
            - `Logistic Regression:` Predict if a candy is chocolate or not based on its other features?  
            - `Random forest Classification:` Predict the win level of the candy  

2. Using flourish to do the visualization and story telling part
